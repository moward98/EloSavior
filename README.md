EloSavior is a REST API I created in Django as a tool for summoners to find potential duo queue partners for League of Legends ranked gameplay. On request, EloSavior makes multiple asynchronous calls to Riot API to get information about the summoner, as well as people they have recently been in ranked matches with. It then determines summoners that might be worthwhile to friend and queue with, using metrics such as ranked win rate, perofrmance in recent matches, and rank. I took this project on to learn more about web frameworks, and specifically how to work with Django and databases. Please stay tuned, as I plan on implementing this API on an acutal website! Thanks for reading!
